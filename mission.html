            <h2 class="our-story_title">Our <span>Story</span></h2>
            <p>We conducted a long analytical study and found out that humanity produces about 300 million tons of
                plastic a year, of which only 12% is recycled. However, to be honest, these numbers are so large that
                the brain refuses to comprehend them. Therefore, we will clarify: two out of three fish on Earth are
                prone to swallowing plastic.</p>

                    <h2 class="solution_block-title">Our simple <span>solution</span></h2>
                    <p class="solution_block-descr">We also know that recycling is spread very unevenly across
                        industries.
                        Plastic beverage bottles are more readily and efficiently recycled, while skincare packaging is
                        more likely to end up in landfill. Products designed to clean and care in the end pollute and
                        destroy.
                    </p>
                    <p class="solution_block-descr"> Why is this happening? Often the reason is in the packaging
                        material, less often it’s the
                        material of the product itself. And, of course, not everyone brings such containers to the right
                        bins.
                    </p>
                    <p class="solution_block-descr">That is why we offer a radically new solution: to completely abandon
                        incremental plastic, that
                        is form of packaging that needs to be bought again and again. And replace it with biodegradable
                        materials. We also offer to pack not a liquid product, which can affect the success of recycling
                        processing, but a dry powder. It is convenient to use and after it, there will be no problems
                        with recycling the materials.</p>
